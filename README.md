## Library Management System

This is a system that will controll and manage the the process of Loaning books,articles,journal e.tc. 
The loans will be qued up for approval
to the Librarian. The Librarian Reserves the right to terminate a library member's membership provided they 
have sufficient grounds to do so.
The Librarian should be able to view,add,delete material(Book,Article e.t.c), publishers and members. 
The Librarian may or may not have an assistant. Managers can view,add,delete administrators and librarians.
The Admin can also manipulate data relating to the librarian but cannot touch anything about the materials or
library members. A registration form is given to all new members,admin and librarians.

This system is for a recently constructed library in my community.
